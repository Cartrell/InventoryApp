# Inventory App, Stage 1
Invenroty app for the Android Basics Nanodegree Program. It makes use of SQLIte tables and database file storage on the device. It writes some books to a table, logs the result of each book as it's written, then displays all the rows of books in the table.

## Lessons of this app:
- Creating a SQLite table in your app
- Populating that table with new entries
- Modifying the entries
- Displaying the contents of the table to users

## Note:
Note that every time this app is run, it will add the same book entries to the table. You clear the app's data (in Android Settings) if you want to delete the database and start over.
